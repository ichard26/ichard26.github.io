Changes have occurred in my personal life that have resulted in me having very little free time. I was thus unable to find the time to write a post in time for pip 25.3. Please enjoy this post for 26.0.\nNew features ✨ Excluding distributions by upload time The new --uploaded-prior-to option allows you to filter packages by their upload time to a package index, only considering packages that were uploaded before a specified datetime. This can be useful for debugging broken dependencies and ensuring reproducible builds by ensuring you only install packages that were available at a known (good) point in time.\nA common situation is that you have a years old project (with no lockfile) and attempting installing the dependencies results in a broken install. With --uploaded-prior-to, you can exclude packages uploaded after the last time you know the install worked and reobtain the same set of working dependencies.\nThe option accepts ISO 8601 datetime strings in several formats:\n2025-03-16 - Date in implicit local timezone 2025-03-16T12:30:00 - Datetime in implict local timezone 2025-03-16T12:30:00Z - Datetime in UTC 2025-03-16T12:30:00+05:00 - Datetime with local timezone offset For consistency, the timezone should be explicitly provided, although it is not required.\npip install -r requirements.txt --uploaded-prior-to 2024-03-16T12:30:00+05:00 [...] Installing collected packages: platformdirs, pathspec, packaging, mypy-extensions, click, black Successfully installed black-24.3.0 click-8.1.7 mypy-extensions-1.0.0 packaging-24.0 pathspec-0.12.1 platformdirs-4.2.0 Warning: it is an exclusive upper bound! While similar to uv’s --exclude-newer option, --uploaded-prior-to behaves a bit differently. Notably, --uploaded-prior-to is an exclusive upper bound for both datetimes and dates. In other words, --uploaded-prior-to 2025-01-01 is equivalent to --uploaded-prior-to 00:00:00, not 2025-01-01 23:59:59 as with --exclude-newer.\nMore information can be found in the pip user guide. We thank uv for the inspiration with their --exclude-newer option.\nSeparate build constraints This feature actually shipped in pip 25.3, but it’s noteworthy enough to mention in this post.\nBuild constraints can be set independently with --build-constraint. This allows constraining the versions of packages used during the build process (e.g., setuptools) without affecting the final installation.\nThis can be useful when a new release of a build backend is causing a package build to error. You can constrain (block) the problematic versions of the backend and continue with happily installing whatever you were installing earlier.\n# constraints.txt setuptools != 80.0.0 # imagine this version broke your build pip install myproject.tar.gz --build-constraint constraints.txt Previously, your best option to constrain build dependencies was through setting the PIP_CONSTRAINT environment variable. Unlike the --constraint option, the envvar would be picked up by the pip subprocess invoked to install build dependencies. This works, but is quite obscure and has the side-effect of constraining the final installation as well.\nAt some point, we would like to stop calling pip in a subprocess to install build dependencies and switch to installing them in-process. This has a bunch of benefits, but would break the PIP_CONSTRAINT workaround. While we could update the --constraint option to also influence build dependencies , we are using this transition as an opportunity to clean up constraint handling.1\nAs part of this transition, pip has deprecated using PIP_CONSTRAINT to constrain build dependencies. Affected users are encouraged to use --build-constraint or set PIP_BUILD_CONSTRAINT.\n--only-final and --all-releases By default, pip installs stable versions of packages, unless their specifier includes a pre-release version (e.g., SomePackage\u003e=1.0a1) or if there are no stable2 versions available that satisfy the requirement. The --all-releases and --only-final options provide per-package control over pre-release selection.\nAs their names imply, these new options allow you to tell pip to only consider stable or all versions when resolving packages. They function like their --no-binary and --prefer-binary cousins.\n# accept the bleeding edge for a dependency python -m pip install --all-releases=DependencyPackage SomePackage # we only accept stable versions for this dependency python -m pip install --only-final=DependencyPackage SomePackage The pre-existing --pre flag is now equivalent to --all-releases :all:.\nFor more information, please consult the pip user guide.\nInstalling from inline script metadata (PEP 723) This release has pip gain the --requirements-from-script option for installing dependencies declared in inline script metadata (PEP 723). Inline script metadata is useful for scripts that depend on external libraries, but are designed to be distributed as a single file.\nRecently, I had to write a script for converting a Jekyll site into a form that could be imported by the Ghost CMS. Jekyll posts are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, which meant I had to pull in PyYAML and a Markdown parser. This is no problem. I can simply declare these dependencies using a script metadata comment. No separate requirements.txt needed.\n\"\"\" Archive Jekyll posts into a JSON file Ghost can import. \"\"\" # /// script # requires-python = \"\u003e=3.11\" # dependencies = [ # \"click\", # \"rich\", # \"python-frontmatter\", # \"markdown-it-py[plugins]\", # \"PyYaml\", # ] # /// import json import subprocess import zipfile # and so on ... To run this script, I can simply run pipx run ghost_export.py. pipx will see the script comment and auto-install the dependencies before executing the script. This is extremely convenient!3\nWhy a new option? This is a good time to explain why this feature is its own option. While we could’ve overloaded the -r option as suggested by some, --requirements-from-script is not equivalent to -r. If requires-python is declared in a script metadata block, pip will validate that the Python version is compatible as well.\nAnd while we think that using pip with inline script metadata is suboptimal (you should really be using a proper script runner), we recognise that there are situations where such script runners are unavailable or undesirable.\n--requirements-from-script can also be given with pip download, pip lock, and pip wheel.\nThank you to @SnoopJ for contributing this feature to pip!\nExperimental: In-process build dependencies The experimental feature to install build dependencies in-process, originally slated for 25.3, has now landed in pip 26.0. You should read my pip 25.2 post for the rational for this change, but the benefits include:\nFaster build environment provisioning More reliable and less confusing option and flag inheritance In the future: support for authentication prompts while installing build dependencies It can be enabled with the --use-feature=inprocess-build-deps flag, although the plan is enable it by default in a future release once the feature stabilizes.\nDeprecations \u0026 upcoming removals Here’s the current list of current deprecations with the release in which they are scheduled for removal. As always, any given removal may be pushed to a future release as needed.\nPIP_CONSTRAINT for build dependencies To be removed in pip 26.1 The PIP_CONSTRAINT envvar will eventually stop taking effect for build dependencies. We’re making this change to accommodate the planned transition to installing build dependencies in-process. Affected users should use --build-constraint or PIP_BUILD_CONSTRAINT. This also has the nice benefit of aligning our constraint options with uv which already has --build-constraint. ↩︎\nWhat is a stable version? Any package whose version does NOT contain a development segment or pre-release segment (.alpha, .beta, .rc, .dev). ↩︎\nYou can use uv run as well. ↩︎\n","wordCount":"1202","inLanguage":"en-ca","datePublished":"2026-01-30T00:00:00-05:00","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ichard26.github.io/blog/2026/01/whats-new-in-pip-26.0/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Person","name":"Richard Si","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ichard26.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ichard26.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Richard Si (Alt + H)">Richard Si</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://ichard26.github.io/about/ title=About><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ichard26.github.io/blog/ title=Writing><span>writing</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ichard26.github.io/privacy/ title="Privacy Statement"><span>privacy</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">What's new in pip 26.0 - prerelease and upload-time filtering!</h1><div class=post-description>pip 26.0 includes support for reading requirements from inline script metadata, excluding distributions by upload time, per-package prerelease selection, and experimental support for in-process build dependencies.</div><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date title='Posted on 2026-01-30 00:00:00 -0500 EST'>January 30, 2026</span><span class=delimiter>&nbsp;·&nbsp;</span>6 minutes</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#new-features- aria-label="New features ✨">New features ✨</a><ul><li><a href=#excluding-distributions-by-upload-time aria-label="Excluding distributions by upload time">Excluding distributions by upload time</a></li><li><a href=#separate-build-constraints aria-label="Separate build constraints">Separate build constraints</a></li><li><a href=#--only-final-and---all-releases aria-label="--only-final and --all-releases">--only-final and --all-releases</a></li><li><a href=#installing-from-inline-script-metadata-pep-723 aria-label="Installing from inline script metadata (PEP 723)">Installing from inline script metadata (PEP 723)</a></li><li><a href=#experimental-in-process-build-dependencies aria-label="Experimental: In-process build dependencies">Experimental: In-process build dependencies</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#deprecations--upcoming-removals aria-label="Deprecations & upcoming removals">Deprecations & upcoming removals</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>On January 30, 2026, we, the pip team, released pip 26.0.</p><p>As always, please <a href=https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/news/#v25-2 target=_blank>consult the changelog</a> to learn about all of the changes

<span>Why a new option?</span></div><div class=admonition-content><p>This is a good time to explain why this feature is its own option.
While we could&rsquo;ve overloaded the <code>-r</code> option as suggested by some,
<code>--requirements-from-script</code> is <em>not</em> equivalent to <code>-r</code>. If <code>requires-python</code> is
declared in a script metadata block, pip will validate that the Python version is
compatible as well.</p></div></div><p>And while we think that using pip with inline script metadata is suboptimal (you should
really be using a proper script runner), we recognise that there are situations where such
script runners are unavailable or undesirable.</p><p><code>--requirements-from-script</code> can also be given with <code>pip download</code>, <code>pip lock</code>, and
<code>pip wheel</code>.</p><p>Thank you to <a href=https://github.com/SnoopJ target=_blank>@SnoopJ</a> for contributing this feature to pip!</p><h3 id=experimental-in-process-build-dependencies>Experimental: In-process build dependencies<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#experimental-in-process-build-dependencies>#</a></h3><p>The experimental feature to install build dependencies in-process, originally slated for
25.3, has now landed in pip 26.0. You should
<a href=/blog/2025/07/whats-new-in-pip-25.2/#sneak-peek-in-process-build-dependencies>read my pip 25.2 post for the rational for this change</a>,
but the benefits include:</p><ul><li>Faster build environment provisioning</li><li>More reliable and less confusing option and flag inheritance</li><li>In the future: support for authentication prompts while installing build dependencies</li></ul><p>It can be enabled with the <code>--use-feature=inprocess-build-deps</code> flag, although the plan is
enable it by default in a future release once the feature stabilizes.</p><h2 id=deprecations--upcoming-removals>Deprecations & upcoming removals<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#deprecations--upcoming-removals>#</a></h2><p>Here&rsquo;s the current list of current deprecations with the release in which they are
scheduled for removal. As always, any given removal may be <strong>pushed to a future release as
needed</strong>.</p><dl><dt><code>PIP_CONSTRAINT</code> for build dependencies <em>To be removed in pip 26.1</em></dt><dd>The <code>PIP_CONSTRAINT</code> envvar will eventually stop taking effect for build dependencies.
We&rsquo;re making this change to accommodate the planned transition to installing build
dependencies in-process. Affected users should use <code>--build-constraint</code> or
<code>PIP_BUILD_CONSTRAINT</code>.</dd></dl><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>This also has the nice benefit of aligning our constraint options with uv which
