If more attempts are desired, you may configure a higher limit with --resume-retries.\nIn addition, caching support was added to resumed downloads so pip does not need to redownload files as expected.\nThe download ETA is replaced by the elapsed time once the download has completed. While ETA 0:00:00 is technically correct, it is not useful information ðŸ˜‰\nThe truststore and proxy features can be used together without conflicting with each other.\nSub-commands are included in TAB completion.\nDeprecations \u0026 upcoming removals Hereâ€™s the current list of current deprecations with the release in which they are scheduled for removal. As always, any given removal may be pushed to a future release as needed.\nNon-bare project name in egg fragment To be removed in pip 25.3 See the pip 25.0 post for more details. This got pushed to pip 25.3 as the support for the Direct URL syntax for installing editable VCS projects did not land in this release, sadly. Legacy setup.py editable installs To be removed in pip 25.3 Please read the deprecation issue for more details and advice. This was scheduled for removal in 25.0 and then 25.1, but it got pushed back (again) to coincide with the deprecation of setup.py bdist_wheel installs. Legacy setup.py bdist_wheel installs To be removed in pip 25.3 Please read the deprecation issue for more details and advice, however, the summary is that pip will stop running setup.py bdist_wheel directly to build a wheel for installation. This is a compatibility fallback for old environments that do not support the modern PEP 517 interface. Non-standard wheel filenames To be removed in pip 25.3 This is a continuation of the old deprecation as the original deprecation did not catch all non-standard wheel filenames. See the pip 25.0 post for more details. Sneak peek: in-process build dependencies Since this release post is so small, I thought Iâ€™d take the time to share what Iâ€™ve been working on in addition to my typical maintainer duties.\nIf youâ€™ve ever installed a project from source, youâ€™ve likely noticed that pip takes a while to build the project.\ntime pip install ./dev/oss/pip Processing /home/ichard26/dev/oss/pip Installing build dependencies ... done Getting requirements to build wheel ... done Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) ... done Building wheels for collected packages: pip Building wheel for pip (pyproject.toml) ... done Created wheel for pip: filename=pip-25.2.dev0-py3-none-any.whl size=1856601 sha256=8d02c1146bbeaa023421ac298240575fc2e96400ac3a7f86209426a8254dc0f8 Stored in directory: /tmp-ram/pip-ephem-wheel-cache-4ctznmto/wheels/de/a6/21/441242ad27acc3bddc1079ff202cc70bad47d31432987f2bf0 Successfully built pip Installing collected packages: pip Successfully installed pip-25.2.dev0 real 0m2.986s user 0m2.132s sys 0m0.527s While pip is generally not fast, PEP 517 buildsâ€”which is the modern/default mechanism for building projectsâ€”are particularly heavy. If I disable PEP 517 processing and force pip to use the legacy setuptools-specific build mechanism, the install is noticeably faster.\ntime pip install ./dev/oss/pip --no-use-pep517 [...] real 0m1.919s user 0m1.486s sys 0m0.413s The overhead of PEP 517 processing comes from two main sources:\nThe PEP 517 interface itself. To build a project in the PEP 517 way, pip must call Python hooks provided by the configured build backend. For example, PEP 517 backends must supply a build_wheel function which when called builds the project and returns the path to the resultant wheel. All of these calls are mandated to occur in fresh subprocesses which each incur a Python startup/shutdown penalty. Yikes!\nBuild isolation. In PEP 517 mode, pip by default sets up a temporary isolated environment to perform the build in. The build backend and any additional build dependencies are installed to this temporary environment on the fly.\nIn practice, pip has to call effectively the same hooks even under the legacy mechanism so the design is not actually any slower.2 The additional overhead is from build isolation. Creating the temporary environment is cheap, but installing build dependencies is very much not.\nA major part of the install time is spent on accessing the network. Yes, pip is checking PyPI (or the configured index) to determine the most up to date versions of build dependencies every time it sets up a build environment. This is why building from source often requires active Internet access with modern pip.3\nHowever, another major source of the overhead is from invoking a pip in a subprocess to install build dependencies. Large Python applications are rather slow to start up and pip is no exception. For example, pip install --help takes ~220ms to execute on my system.\nStarting a new pip process also comes with other cons, including numerous bugs related to configuration not being passed down and abysmal error reporting.\nConsequently, weâ€™ve wanted to replace this mechanism and switch to installing build dependencies within the same root pip process for years.\nThe good news is that this work is finally starting to happen!\nIâ€™ve published a draft PR that would add an alternative mechanism which installs build dependencies in-process. There will be behavioural differences compared to the current subprocess installation method, but those will be covered in a future post when the feature is generally available for testing. The good news is that it is already demonstrating performance improvements.\ntime pip install . --use-feature=inprocess-build-deps [...] real 0m2.672s user 0m1.836s sys 0m0.483s In comparison with the initial example, 300ms has been saved which is in line with the startup overhead of the pip install command.4 The configuration inheritance story related to build dependencies will be cleaned up as part of this effort, too.\nThere remains considerable work (notably around error handling and adding more tests) before the PR is ready for review, but if everything goes to plan, it should be available in pip 25.3 as an experimental feature.\nWell, it should be supported, anyway. There were lots of test failures on Python 3.14 due to URL\u003c-\u003epath conversion issues. They were caused by a mix of upstream changes in pathname2url() and url2pathname() and then undiscovered bugs in pipâ€™s URL\u003c-\u003epath utilities. It was hell, and frankly, Iâ€™m not 100% sure everything is right as I am barely an expert on file URLs (even after reading RFCs for an hour).Â â†©ï¸Ž\nAlthough the design does serve to limit the lowest achievable build times even with well-optimized tools like uv.Â â†©ï¸Ž\nWe recognize that itâ€™d be nice if pip supported an offline mode where pip fell back to using whatever packages were already stored in the HTTP or wheel caches, but unfortunately, this would require a major refactoring of the caching stack. If youâ€™d like to help us out and suggest a proposal thatâ€™s feasible with the limited resources the pip project has, you are more than welcome to do so.Â â†©ï¸Ž\nRemember that there is even more overhead beyond initial import times. A new pip process also needs to configure the network stack (which can be quite slow on some systems), load configuration, and shut down properly.Â â†©ï¸Ž\n","wordCount":"1214","inLanguage":"en-ca","datePublished":"2025-07-30T00:00:00-04:00","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ichard26.github.io/blog/2025/07/whats-new-in-pip-25.2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Person","name":"Richard Si","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ichard26.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ichard26.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Richard Si (Alt + H)">Richard Si</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://ichard26.github.io/about/ title=About><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ichard26.github.io/blog/ title=Writing><span>writing</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ichard26.github.io/privacy/ title="Privacy Statement"><span>privacy</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">What's new in pip 25.2 ... and a sneak peek of 25.3</h1><div class=post-description>pip 25.2 is a small release.

changes in <code>pathname2url()</code> and <code>url2pathname()</code> and then undiscovered bugs in pip&rsquo;s
URL&lt;->path utilities. It was hell, and frankly, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure everything is right

stack. If you&rsquo;d like to help us out and suggest a proposal that&rsquo;s feasible with the
