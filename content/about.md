Hello! I'm Richard. I go by `ichard26` on the internet.

You may know me if you frequent the Python code quality space as I used to co-maintain
your friendly code formatter, [Black]!

I'm a hobby Python developer who writes command line tooling, but I dabble in C and
front-end web development from time to time. When I'm not doing development work, I like
to take photographs, go for walks .. or both at the same time! ðŸ“·

## Open Source Software (OSS)

While I do work on personal projects occasionally, I primarily contribute to open source
projects. The projects I'm proud to have contributed to are:

[black] _co-maintainer_ _2020 - 2023_
: Black is the most popular Python autoformatter; known for its *uncomprising code style*.
  I was a co-maintainer since 2021 and a triager since 2020.

[bandersnatch] _co-maintainer_ _2021 - 2023_
: A simple mirror tool generating a PEP 503 compliant index ready to be served on your
  static web server of choice.

[diff-shades] _creator_ _2021 - present_
: A development tool used to gauge the impact of code style changes in Black across OSS
  code. Inspired by [mypy-primer] which was inspired by [black-primer].

[next-pr-number] _creator_ _2021 - present_
: A simple web utility to query the number the next PR would have for a public Github
  repository.

[ghstats] _creator_ _2022 - present_
: My personal playground for visualizing data from the GitHub API.

[mypyc] _triager & contributor_ _2023 - present_
: A transcompiler of Python modules to C extensions built on top of mypy. It uses standard
  Python type hints and mypy's type checking and type inference features to generate fast
  code.

[pip] _co-maintainer_ _2024 - present_
: "pip installs packages" - The de facto official Python package installer.
