Hello, I'm Richard aka "ichard26" - pronouns are he/they.

You might know me if you frequent the Python formatter/linter space as I co-maintain the
incredibly popular [psf/black][black] project. I also co-maintain
[pypa/bandersnatch][bandersnatch]. My main area of focus is usually maintainance and
devops work so developer experience, CI, issue triage, and PR review are my main duties
-- although I'm a documentation nerd as well. I'm also staff on the
[Python Discord server][discord].

I'm mostly a Python developer although I have ventured a little bit into JS/TS and C. My
projects are typically of the tooling (just look above) or language dev nature (I have
this unreasonable persisent desire to write parsers). When I'm not doing development work,
I like to take photographs, go for walks .. or both at the same time ðŸ“·

## Projects

[black] _co-maintainer_ _2020 - present_
: Black is most popular Python autoformatter known for its uncomprising code style. I've
  been a co-maintainer, handling all aspects of development and maintenance since 2021.

[bandersnatch] _co-maintainer_ _2021 - present_
: A simple mirror tool generating a PEP 503 compliant index ready to be served on your
  static web server of choice!

[diff-shades] _creator_ _2021 - present_
: Development tool used gauge the impact of code style changes in Black across OSS code.

[next-pr-number] _creator_ _2021 - present_
: A simple web utility to query the number the next PR would have for a public Github
  repository.

[ghstats] _creator_ _2022 - present_
: My personal playground for psf/black statistics.

[blackbench] _creator_ _2021 - present_
: Benchmarking suite for Black created originally for my mypyc work; needs a rewrite :p

This website exists as a place to put my F/OSS related ramblings, I'm not
quite sure what exactly I'll write about it but hey y'all can watch me as I learn this
blogging thing.

Anyhow, have a wonderful day! âœ¿
