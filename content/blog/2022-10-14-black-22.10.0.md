On October 6th, 2022, [we released Black 22.10.0][black-22.10.0]. It's a smaller release
by the size of the changelog, but hey that means I don't have to write as much!

This is meant to be an accompanying blog post for 22.10.0. I won't discuss every change,
just the ones worth highlighting. Instead, I'll go into more detail, providing context and
explanations (and probably some behind of scenes stuff too -- this isn't official anyway).
I know this is a bit late, but I hope this is still insightful.

If you'd like the full changelog for 22.10.0, please refer to the link above.

## Packaging

### Goodbye Python 3.6 (and hello Hatchling!)

It's official: **you can no longer run Black on Python 3.6 starting with 22.10.0**.[^1]

This is actually the first time Black has ever dropped runtime support since 3.6+ was
required from the start.[^2]

We dropped Python 3.6 because we wanted to switch build backends from Setuptools to
[Hatchling] which only supports 3.7+. Setuptools has served us well as a simple and
reliable backend, but we wanted to modernize. While Setuptools does finally now support
most packaging standards (PEP 517, PEP 621, PEP 660 and more) our needs are a bit unique.

We use [mypyc] to compile Black for a significant performance boost. Before Hatchling we
hand-rolled our own integration using mypyc's basic Setuptools build API. It worked well
enough, but it meant we would be stuck with `setup.py` forever until a Setuptools plugin
for mypyc is available. (*one does not exist as of writing*)

All of the reasons behind the switch [can be found in the PR][gh-3233], but in essence,
Hatchling allowed us to move to static metadata in `pyproject.toml` while providing us
with a nicer mypyc integration thanks to its [hatch-mypyc] plugin.

Switching to Hatchling hasn't been as simple as I would've wished: we had to track down
[this confusing linker error][gh-3272] that only appears when using build isolation (among
other situations) and now our [macOS builds are producing mislabelled wheels][gh-3312],
ugh. It happens.

### Compiled wheels for 3.11

We couldn't build mypyc wheels for CPython 3.11 since we had been using an older manylinux
docker image to avoid the linker error mentioned earlier. It was old enough that 3.11
wasn't pre-installed!

Once the linker error was addressed by [@zsol] (thank you, I had no chance of figuring it
out), it was pretty straightforward to configure cibuildwheel to build CPython 3.11
wheels.
[Just a CIBW upgrade, a type error fix, and a workaround so that aiohttp doesn't fail to install on 3.11.][gh-3276]

## Code style

### Failing to put `fmt: on` at the same indent level as `fmt: off` no longer crashes

Previously Black produced invalid code when `# fmt: on` is placed on a different indent
level than the `# fmt: off` it’s paired with. Black failed similarly when `# fmt: on` just
didn't exist.

```python3
def x():
    # fmt: off
    return

def y():
    return
```

```console
$ black issue-569.py
error: cannot format issue-569.py: INTERNAL ERROR: Black produced code that is not equivalent to the source.  Please report a bug on https://github.com/psf/black/issues.  This diff might be helpful: /tmp/blk_wv8p1p5k.log

Oh no! 💥 💔 💥
1 file failed to reformat.
```

If you disable the safety checks with `--fast`, you'll quickly realize that Black badly
messed up the indentation.

```python3
def x():
    # fmt: off
    return

    def y():
        return
```

This annoying bug was often hit. If you look at the [original issue's timeline][gh-569],
you'll notice that this bug has been reported many, *many* times over. Yet, this bug was
left unfixed for almost three years until [@yilei] opened [GH-3281] to finally fix it.

Black still requires `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` to be used at the same indent level, but
now, the code at or above the initial `# fmt: off`'s block level will be left untouched,
when `# fmt: on` is used on a different level or there is no `# fmt: on`.

In other words, you can now use a single `# fmt: off` to turn off formatting by block
level.

```python3
def ignore_this_function(condition):
    # fmt: off
    if condition:
        return 'hello, world'


def format_this_function():
    def except_this_block_level():
        # fmt: off
        return 'hello, world'

    return except_this_block_level ()
```

```diff
$ black file.py --diff --color
--- file.py	2022-10-15 18:30:53.887339 +0000

-    return except_this_block_level ()
+    return except_this_block_level()
```

Anyway, I'm so happy this major bug has finally been fixed. Thank you so much @yilei!

### Preview style: fixed a crash related to string keys in dictionaries

[Parentheses are added around implicitly concatenated strings in various situations under the preview style][gh-3162]
since 22.8.0. Unfortunately, this introduced a bug where long string keys would be wrapped
in extra parentheses along with the value.

```python3
v = {
    ('a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_'
     'a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_'): {
        'key':
            'value',
    },
}
```

```diff
 v = {
-    ('a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_'
-     'a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_'): {
-        'key':
-            'value',
-    },
+    (
+        "a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_a_very_long_str_": {
+            "key": "value",
+        }
+    ),
 }
```

Now Black no longer adds these invalid parentheses, although it just merges the strings
together violating the line length which doesn't seem right...

## GitHub Action improvements

The GitHub Action can now format Jupyter Notebooks if you set `jupyter: true`:

```yaml
- uses: psf/black@stable
  with:
    src: "./src"
    jupyter: true
    version: "22.10.0"
```

Under the hood, it will install Black with the `jupyter` extra enabling Black's optional
support for `.ipynb` files.

Additionally, the `version` key now supports [PEP 440] version specifiers. This is a great
QOL improvement because if you want to match versions covered by Black’s
[stability policy], you can use the compatible release operator (`~=`) to do that now:

```yaml
- uses: psf/black@stable
  with:
    src: "./src"
    version: "~= 22.0"
```

By restricting to 2022 releases, the latest version possible will be used without sudden
changes (breaking your CI) since releases within the same year are guaranteed to not
change the stable style.

This was a backwards-compatible change, you can still specify a single version if you'd
like.

## `-x` / `--skip-source-first-line`

[Python has a flag (`-x`) to skip the first line of files given][-x]. I didn't know this
existed, but it turns out it's commonly used with Python WASM pages. They shove the HTML
code in a single line at the start as a non-standard "shebang" (since browsers generally
require HTML files to start with `<`) so it can run in the browser *and* locally.

For example, [this browser pong game uses pygame][pygame-pong] via [pygbag] (a WASM
version of pygame). The start of the HTML file looks like this:

```html
<html><head><meta charset="utf-8"></head><script src="https://pygame-web.github.io/archives/0.3/pythons.js" type=module id="__main__" data-src="gui" async defer>#<!--
import sys
import os
import asyncio
```

Since all the HTML code is at the top in a single line, you can run it as any other Python
script by simply passing `-x`.

```console
wget https://pygame-web.github.io/showroom/pygame-scripts/org.pygame.touchpong.html
# assuming pygame is installed
python -x org.pygame.touchpong.html
```

I was hesitant to add a similar option to Black, but it was a convincing use-case and
[the issue got a surprising amount of upvotes][gh-3214].

This option is also available for Blackd.

______________________________________________________________________

... and that's all. Thanks for reading! ❀

[^1]: We weren't planning to remove 3.6 support in 22.10.0. We believed that Python 3.6 was
    too popular to stop supporting. The earliest agreed-upon removal date was 2023. But
    after even more internal discussion,
    [we eventually decided to drop 3.6 earlier][3.6-earlier].

[^2]: Łukasz couldn't live without his f-strings :)
