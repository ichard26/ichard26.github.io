## Building compiled wheels with GitHub Actions

With the mypyc branch functional and pretty fast, it was time to automate building the
wheels. Not only does this make the release process easier, but **it also means I can
easily build wheels for platforms I don't have access to**, like MacOS.

To make the CI configuration process easier, I finally took a look at [cibuildwheel]. I
won't go into my exact process since it was basically trial and error + my many dumb
mistakes üòÖ [^10] but here are some noteworthy takeaways:

- If you're using `setuptools-scm`, you might have to do a full clone on CI so the tag
  history is still available by build time

- **Read cibuildwheel's documentation before writing any configuration!** Seriously, if I
  did I wouldn't have to make [this commit][read-the-bloody-docs] adding `{project}` to
  the test command

- Set `CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY` to at least `1` because it will make debugging build errors
  (and trust me you will get some!) so much nicer

- If wheel sizes are an issue then passing `debug_level=0` to `mypyc.build.mypycify`
  should help by stripping all debug information. Not great if you hit a bunch of
  segfaults or similar though, so it's a tradeoff

So yeah, 20-ish commits later I had a basic but functional setup which could compile
wheels for x86-64 Windows, MacOS, and Linux from CPython 3.6 to CPython 3.10. Universial2
and ARM variants were also supported for the shiny M1 platform. The workflow is a bit
slow, but that's expected and not a big deal.

If you're curious, you can find the workflow here: [ichard26/black-mypyc-wheels]

> I don't recommend using my workflow to build your own wheels since it's a bit hacky
> and in need of a cleanup. I'd instead recommend taking a look at the
> [examples in cibuildwheel's docs][cibuildwheel-examples].

I was going to mention the community field testing campaign I carried out that had its own
package index, but honestly it was for the most part a failure as it reached no one. In
hindsight, I did not promote it enough so yeah this one is on me :)

## Stable release prep and shipping the wheels

Black for the longest time ever wasn't stable (see [GH-517]). The team initially aimed to
stabilize Black in late 2018, but that didn't happen for reasons. I won't go
into it too much since it'd be a whole other story, but suffice to say when we made
our newest "commitment" (at that point we explicitly worded our intentions to *not* be
promises) **we were very motivated to get it done and hopefully right.**

We drafted a [stablity policy][stability-policy],
[dropped Python 2 support][cya-python-two], [introduced the `--preview` flag][hi-preview],
and [so much more][changelog] [^11].

In this time I rewrote diff-shades into [what it is today][diff-shades], a reliable enough
tool used to [provide direct][diff-shades-comment-1]
[feedback on PRs][diff-shades-comment-2]. I tried to integrate it into the wheel build
workflow as part of the test step, but that turned out be very painful and I backed out of
it since I had a stable release to manage and publish!

*The TL;DR of it is as follows:*

Building Black with mypyc usually requires disabling pip's build isolation to work
properly as mypyc is not a standard build dependency of Black. This messes up the
installation of diff-shades which is packaged using flit. So I hacked up a script to edit
the `[build-system].requires` field in `pyproject.toml` to include mypyc pre-build, but
the isolation somehow broke the linker search path or something.

```text
clang -Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -g0 -fPIC -I/tmp/pip-build-env-9bfrmy6j/overlay/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mypyc/lib-rt -Ibuild -I/opt/python/cp37-cp37m/include/python3.7m -c build/__native_f2d4935fd652bc9ef29d.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7/build/__native_f2d4935fd652bc9ef29d.o -O3 -Werror -Wno-unused-function -Wno-unused-label -Wno-unreachable-code -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-command-line-argument -Wno-unknown-warning-option

    clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
    error: command '/usr/bin/clang' failed with exit code 1
```

I honestly still have no idea what's wrong.

Anyway since I was like an hour or more into build errors, I just decided to call it done
and fall back to the basic testing that was already working.[^12] I triggered the last
workflow run of the day, downloaded the artifacts, tested one of them locally to make sure
nothing was on fire, and pushed 'em to PyPI and that's how release 22.1.0 was born üéâ.

The core team chat was quite lively for the next hour, to say the least; after all, we just
finished a major milestone! Also yeah, we *may* have done a lot of publicizing for this
release which is why it was everywhere for a while :wink:

### Post release calm

To be honest I haven't really seen anyone comment on the fact Black is now compiled with
mypyc yet short of this one [mini blog post][that-one-post-about-black-mypyc] ... which is
both disappointing since I spent so much time on this effort, but also calming since
usually buzz is sparked by bugs and whatnot.

Having mentioned bugs and crashes, so far we've received two reports,
[one bug probably from mypyc and an unintentional restriction on Black's unofficial APIs][not-too-many-fires-so-far].

Version 22.1.0 still unintentionally broke quite a few integrations, though they
weren't mypyc related. Turns out lots of people depend on `black.files.find_project_root`
returning a `pathlib.Path` and nothing else! I've seen at least five issues / PRs on
GitHub fixing crashes related to our change making it return a tuple instead.

For this reason we, the core team, want to [define a stable API (GH-779)][gh-779] soon. I
can't promise anything as Black's development is volunteer-based, but if you were curious
to what's next for psf/black, there's this.

## Results & final thoughts

**Black is now overall 2 times faster**[^1]. And as a bonus, startup time is down too (at
most by 15%). You can [read the whole report here][perf-report]. Please note these numbers
were gathered quite a long time ago and **they are probably a bit outdated**, especially
with the recent blib2to3 changes made to support 3.10 syntax.

From my experience, I believe mypyc will make for an interesting, but viable solution to
speeding up Python code going forward. It's far from perfect and still has a bunch of
bugs, but today it is already making an impact. Should you use it in production if you
don't want to feel like being a beta tester? Certainly not, but it's sure still possible
and I'm happy with the results!

I hope to see the mypyc project gain more contributors and succeed. Along with Cython,
PyPy, and the recent faster-cpython project, **perhaps Python will have a solid speed
story**.

Congrats on reaching the end of this multi-part blog post!

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank [@msullivan] for his original work on integrating mypyc into Black,
spawning this summer project and eventually this blog series :)

[^10]: If you are in need of some quality entertainment, look at this commit history:
    <https://github.com/ichard26/black-mypyc-wheels/commits/main>

[^11]: I would link to the 22.1.0 heading, but currently the HTML IDs are uhhh ... terrible
    and don't persist. I've tried fixing this with a custom sphinx extension but it
    failed. I have other ideas left to try, but yeah :(

[^12]: I was frustrated and had a headache thanks to the stress üôÉ

[^1]: Originally when I first landed the relevant PR it was an overall 2x improvement, but
    once Jelle added a stability hotfix the *effective* speedup for files that are changed
    is 50%. If you're formatting a bunch of already well formatted files, the speedup is
    still 2x
